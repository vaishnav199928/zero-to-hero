Compliers and interpreters are programs that help convert the high level language (Source Code) into machine language so that machine can understand.
Computers cannot understand high level languages as we do.
So there comes the roll of Compilers And Interpreters.
To convert High level language to Machine language(binary code)
Interpreters                                                                                             Compilers
> Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.                  > Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into 
                                                                                                           machine code at once.
> An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time              > A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. However, 
 to execute the process is much slower.                                                                    the overall time taken to execute the process is much faster.
